# 📝 Description

> Fastest Tibia PixelBot developed in python to get unlocked fps.

_Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [Brazilian Portuguese](README.pt-BR.md)._

This BOT works locating image around the screen and applies cache to avoid image redetection and thus avoid excessive cpu/gpu usage.

This BOT is all based on matrix calculation, also applies parallelism and also pre-processing, as it is the only way to have maximum performance(nanoseconds/microseconds).

This BOT also uses data structure, arrays, path finding, among other important things to have smart decisions and gameplay.

This BOT walks by keyboard and make human mouse movimentation.

I created this BOT to learn python, to stream on twitch, to make friends, to apply my knowledgments in deep learning, path finding, matrix, etc.

I'm not going to sell subscription to this BOT, but it will work on "global" and you can use it, it's at your own risk.

This BOT ins't ready yet, this BOT still under construction.

Be free to use any function to create your custom BOT or wait for the release of v0.

# 🤖 BearSharp

Due to personal commitments that demand my attention, I'm temporarily pausing the development of the bot project for Tibia. However, I'm happy to share that my friend has a fantastic project called BearSharp which offers excellent features and is continually updated. While my project is down, I encourage you to check out BearSharp's exceptional work. I'm sure you'll find everything you need and more there.

Here is the BearSharp discord link: https://discord.gg/rqm9E3EGBr

Thank you for your understanding and I continue to look forward to resuming my work as soon as possible.
